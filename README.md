# IP.BIN Creator

This tool generates a custom `IP.BIN` bootstrap for any homebrew software
targeting the **Sega Dreamcast**, through a nice-to-use wizard. A console
version using the same engine is also available.

The **GUI** version was firstly released on **Jan 18, 2005**, when the **Console**
version was released on **May 31, 2005**.

# Usage

* For the **GUI** version, you just have to run the software then follow the
steps on-screen. If you want to insert a logo, its size must be set to `320x90` 
and `128` colors max. Supported formats are `BMP`, `GIF`, `JPEG`, `PNG` or even better,
the specific `MR` format.
* For the **Console** version, just type `ipcreate -h` to display the screen help.
